# CPP

A set of challenges increasing in difficulty, 
each covering a different core aspect of C++

#### Module 00 
Getting started with the absolute basics such as Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const etc. 
Just some basic functions and a mini phonebook program to get comfortable with the C++ format 

#### Module 01
Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement
Writing some basic classes and understanding the differences to C regarding memory allocation and pointers/references

#### Module 02
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form
From this point on, we were required to write all classes in Orthodox Canonical form.
We then made a class for a basic implementation of Fixed point numbers (which I have recently spent some time expandin on)

#### Module 03
Class Inheritance
Extremely repetitive exercises to understand class inheretance

#### Module 04
Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes
Once again very repetitive exercises to create Abstract classes and unserstand polymorphism and how subtypes interact etc.

#### Module 05
These exercises were a more challenging recap of the previous modules, and also introduced exceptions

#### Module 06
Understanding the different types of C++ casting and their use cases 

#### Module 07
Template functions and classes 

#### Module 08
Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
More complex exersises using templates and implementing different algorithms (search, span)
Also modifying containers to add iterators

#### Module 09
A series of challenges using STL containers to solve problems. Each container can only be used once for the whole module, so containers had to be chosen carefully. 

Funnily enough (or, not really funnily) CPP 09 used to not exist, and there was a completely different project requiring us to reimplement several STL containers completely from scratch (including ALL operators, members, iterators.... completely by hand). I was about 2 months into that project before it was deprecated and CPP09 was introduced. I had already become one with the containers, so this was actually a piece of cake haha. 


## Usage: 
  - run `make` for each individual exercise
  - if any user further input is required, it will say in the command line

### Personal Experience:
While the projects themselves may not seem crazily impressive, I feel like this while series of challenges actually did give me a very solid foundation for C++.

I also enjoyed having some direction while getting started, as a lot of resources out there for when you want to learn a language on your own start out from programming basics and don't give you a lot of free reign when practicing. Because of the repetitive nature of some of the exercises, I did take some creative liberty here and there to add least add a little fun in for myself.
